The test file shows how to traverse a two dimensional array in a column major way. What
worked for me was to switch the i, and j lines and leave everything else the same.
Remember i still refers to the row and j refers to the column

But I could not avoid having to transpose the two dimensinal arrays and Picture
objects because System.arraycopy still copies one row at a time. This would have
still worked if I only wanted to do one thing inside the nested loop. But I wanted
to update the energy array and the Picture objects. In addition to that, most
images had different height and width.
